# FEMdemo
Demo codes for FEM (Finite Element Method) workshop.
We are following A First Course in Finite Elements by Jacob Fish and Ted Belytschko.

### Part 1: Finite element formulation for one-dimensional problems

Tensile of 1D beams with uniform and non-uniform cross-section.

### Part 2: Finite element formulation for scalar field problems in multidimensions

### Part 3: Finite element formulation for vector field problems in two dimensions
